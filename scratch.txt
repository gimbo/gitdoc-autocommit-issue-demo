This is the file which I'll just add things to to explore the behaviour of the extension.

This paragraph should be the first to be added by GitDoc; I'll save it and leave
VSCode open so GitDoc can commit it after the specified delay (10 seconds for
this repo).

Yep, that seems to have worked ok.  Good!

Now I'll write this paragraph, save the file, wait for the git timeline in the
Explorer sidebar to show "Uncommitted changes", and then quit VSCode.  My
understanding is that GitDoc *should* commit this change at that moment because
the setting `gitdoc.commitOnClose` is `true` (that's its default but I've also
explicitly set it as such in this repo's `.vscode/settings.json`) â€” but my
experience is that that won't in fact happen.
